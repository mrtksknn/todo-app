This repo is the basic to-do app.

I created an account in https://mockapi.io/. Then clone an Api for my todo endpoint.

My goals for this todo project:

1. Getting user name and store in localstorage. Then show somewhere on the page.
2. Creating CRUD function and all function work with api. (add, delete, update, checked)
3. The adding input lenght should be 3 minimum and should not empty.
4. Promise, .then or async/wait should use.
5. Adding for user a spinner when data is loading or updating.
